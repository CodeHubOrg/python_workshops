If life seems jolly rotten 
There's something you've forgotten 
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing 
When you're feeling in the dumps 
Don't be silly, chumps 
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing 
And always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the light side of life
