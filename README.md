# python_workshops

Repository containing resources for a series of Python workshops at Workshop Wednesdays starting in January 2020.  Each workshop takes the form of presented material for approx 1 hour, followed by an hour of self-led study based on material provided via this repo.<br>
The material is provided via Jupyter Notebooks which provides simple exercises initially - getting progressively more difficult.  The focus is on learning by practising rather than theory - links are provided in the notebooks for a further details for those who are interested.
The workshops are aimed at beginners to Python with a particular slant towards those who are particularly interested in Data Science.
